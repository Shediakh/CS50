This is my Week 0 Scratch project.

The project is a Pomodoro timer designed to improve the user's efficiency during his/her work. The instructions are as follows:
-Press the Pomodoro button to start a 25 min timer, during these 25 mins you have to work without stopping. Eliminating distractions is vital for concentration.

-After the timer is up, a sound will be played indicating that the timer has finished. You have the choice between choosing a short break (5 min) or a long break (10 min)

-You can stop the timer any time you want, note that this will reset the timer that is currently on

Note: There are a few bugs that I am unable to fix, its either because of my lack of knowledge in scratch, or that scratch itself is limiting me.
